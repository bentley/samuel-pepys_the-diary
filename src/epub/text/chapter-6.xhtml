			<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-6-1">June 1st</time>. This morning <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sheply disposed of the money that the Duke of York did give my Lord’s servants, 22 ducatoons 3 came to my share, whereof he told me to give Jaspar something because my Lord left him out.<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-163" id="noteref-163" epub:type="noteref">163</a> I did give <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sheply the fine pair of buckskin gloves that I bought myself about five years ago. My Lord took physic today, and so come not out all day. The Captain on shore all day. After dinner Captain Jefferys and <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Howe, and the Lieutenant and I to ninepins, where I lost about two shillings and so fooled away all the afternoon. At night <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooke comes from London with letters, leaving all things there very gallant and joyful. And brought us word that the Parliament had ordered the 29th of May, the King’s birthday, to be forever kept as a day of thanksgiving for our redemption from tyranny, and the King’s return to his Government, he entering London that day. My wife was in London when he came thither, and had been there a week with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bowyer and his wife. My poor wife has not been well a week before, but thanks be to God is well again. She would fain see me and be at her house again, but we must be content. She writes word how the Joyces grow very rich and very proud, but it is no matter, and that there was a talk that I should be knighted by the King, which they (the Joyces) laugh at; but I think myself happier in my wife and estate than they are in theirs. To bed. The Captain come on board, when I was going to bed, quite fuddled; and himself the next morning told me so too, that the Vice-Admiral, Rear-Admiral, and he had been drinking all day.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1660-6-2">2nd</time>. Being with my Lord in the morning about business in his cabin, I took occasion to give him thanks for his love to me in the share that he had given me of his Majesty’s money, and the Duke’s. He told the he hoped to do me a more lasting kindness, if all things stand as they are now between him and the King, but, says he, “We must have a little patience and we will rise together; in the meantime I will do you all the good jobs I can.” Which was great content for me to hear from my Lord. All the morning with the Captain, computing how much the thirty ships that come with the King from Scheveling their pay comes to for a month (because the King promised to give them all a month’s pay), and it comes to £6,538, and the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Charles</i> particularly £777. I wish we had the money. All the afternoon with two or three captains in the Captain’s cabin, drinking of white wine and sugar, and eating pickled oysters, where Captain Sparling told us the best story that ever I heard, about a gentleman that persuaded a country fool to let him gut his oysters or else they would stink. At night writing letters to London and Weymouth, for my Lord being now to sit in the House of Peers he endeavours to get <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Edward Montagu for Weymouth and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> George for Dover. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooke late with me in my cabin while I wrote to my wife, and drank a bottle of wine and so took leave of me on his journey and I to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1660-6-3">3rd</time>. Waked in the morning by one who when I asked who it was, he told me one from Bridewell, which proved Captain Holland. I rose presently to him. He is come to get an order for the setting out of his ship, and to renew his commission. He tells me how every man goes to the Lord Mayor to set down their names, as such as do accept of his Majesty’s pardon, and showed me a certificate under the Lord Mayor’s hand that he had done so.</p>
				<p>At sermon in the morning; after dinner into my cabin, to cast my accounts up, and find myself to be worth near £100, for which I bless Almighty God, it being more than I hoped for so soon, being I believe not clearly worth £25 when I came to sea besides my house and goods. Then to set my papers in order, they being increased much upon my hands through want of time to put them in order. The ship’s company all this while at sermon. After sermon my Lord did give me instruction to write to London about business, which done, after supper to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1660-6-4">4th</time>. Waked in the morning at four o’clock to give some money to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hetly, who was to go to London with the letters that I wrote yesterday night. After he was gone I went and lay down in my gown upon my bed again an hour or two. At last waked by a messenger come for a Post Warrant for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hetly and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed, who stood to give so little for their horses that the men would not let them have any without a warrant, which I sent them. All the morning getting Captain Holland’s commission done, which I did, and he at noon went away. I took my leave of him upon the quarterdeck with a bottle of sack, my Lord being just set down to dinner. Then he being gone I went to dinner and after dinner to my cabin to write. This afternoon I showed my Lord my accounts, which he passed, and so I think myself to be worth near £100 now. In the evening I made an order for Captain Sparling of the Assistance to go to Middleburgh, to fetch over some of the King’s goods. I took the opportunity to send all my Dutch money, 70 ducatoons and 29 gold ducats to be changed, if he can, for English money, which is the first venture that ever I made, and so I have been since a little afeard of it. After supper some music and so to bed. This morning the King’s Proclamation against drinking, swearing, and debauchery, was read to our ships’ companies in the fleet, and indeed it gives great satisfaction to all.<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-164" id="noteref-164" epub:type="noteref">164</a></p>

			<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-6-5">5th</time>. Abed late. In the morning my Lord went on shore with the Vice-Admiral a-fishing, and at dinner returned. In the afternoon I played at ninepins with my Lord, and when he went in again I got him to sign my accounts for £115, and so upon my private balance I find myself confirmed in my estimation that I am worth £100. In the evening in my cabin a great while getting the song without book, “Help, help Divinity, <abbr>etc.</abbr>” After supper my Lord called for the lieutenant’s cittern, and with two candlesticks with money in them for symballs, we made barber’s music,<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-165" id="noteref-165" epub:type="noteref">165</a> with which my Lord was well pleased. So to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1660-6-6">6th</time>. In the morning I had letters come, that told me among other things, that my Lord’s place of Clerk of the Signet was fallen to him, which he did most lovingly tell me that I should execute, in case he could not get a better employment for me at the end of the year. Because he thought that the Duke of York would command all, but he hoped that the Duke would not remove me but to my advantage.</p>
				<p>I had a great deal of talk about my uncle Robert,<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-166" id="noteref-166" epub:type="noteref">166</a> and he told me that he could not tell how his mind stood as to his estate, but he would do all that lay in his power for me. After dinner came <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gooke from London, who told me that my wife he left well at Huntsmore, though her health not altogether so constant as it used to be, which my heart is troubled for. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore’s letters tell me that he thinks my Lord will be suddenly sent for up to London, and so I got myself in readiness to go.</p>
				<p>My letters tell me, that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Calamy<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-167" id="noteref-167" epub:type="noteref">167</a> had preached before the King in a surplice (this I heard afterwards to be false); that my Lord, <abbr>Gen.</abbr> Monk, and three more Lords, are made Commissioners for the Treasury;<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-168" id="noteref-168" epub:type="noteref">168</a> that my Lord had some great place conferred on him, and they say Master of the Wardrobe;<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-169" id="noteref-169" epub:type="noteref">169</a> that the two Dukes<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-170" id="noteref-170" epub:type="noteref">170</a> do haunt the Park much, and that they were at a play, Madam Epicene<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-171" id="noteref-171" epub:type="noteref">171</a> the other day; that Sir <abbr class="name">Ant.</abbr> Cooper, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hollis, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Annesly,&amp; late President of the Council of State, are made Privy Councillors to the King. At night very busy sending <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Donne away to London, and wrote to my father for a coat to be made me against I come to London, which I think will not be long.

About three in the morning the people began to wash the deck, and the water came pouring into my mouth, which waked me, and I was fain to rise and get on my gown, and sleep leaning on my table. This morning <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Montagu went away again. After dinner come <abbr>Mr.</abbr> John Wright and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore, with the sight of whom my heart was very glad.

The children did sing finely, and my Lord did bid me give them five pieces in gold at his going away. Thence back to White Hall, where, the King being gone abroad, my Lord and I walked a great while discoursing of the simplicity of the Protector, in his losing all that his father had left him. My Lord told me, that the last words that he parted with the Protector with (when he went to the Sound), were, that he should rejoice more to see him in his grave at his return home, than that he should give way to such things as were then in hatching, and afterwards did ruin him: and the Protector said, that whatever <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Montagu, my Lord Broghill, Jones, and the Secretary, would have him to do, he would do it, be it what it would. Thence to my wife, meeting <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Blagrave, who went home with me, and did give me a lesson upon the flageolet, and handselled my silver can with my wife and me.

Then to Sir Geffery Palmer, to give them to him to have bills drawn upon them, who told me that my Lord must have some good Latinist to make the preamble to his Patent, which must express his late service in the best terms that he can, and he told me in what high flaunting terms Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Greenville had caused his to be done, which he do not like; but that Sir Richard Fanshawe had done General Monk’s very well. Back to Westminster, and meeting <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Townsend in the Palace, he and I and another or two went and dined at the Leg there. Then to White Hall, where I was told by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hutchinson at the Admiralty, that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlow, my predecessor, Clerk of the Acts, is yet alive, and coming up to town to look after his place, which made my heart sad a little. At night told my Lord thereof, and he bade me get possession of my Patent; and he would do all that could be done to keep him out. This night my Lord and I looked over the list of the Captains,. and marked some that my Lord had a mind to have put out. Home and to bed. Our wench very lame, abed these two days.</p>
